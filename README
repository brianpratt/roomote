Roomote is an iPhone app created to act as a remote control for an iRobot Roomba or Created robot. It has been tested on a Roomba 550, but should work with any Roomba using the SCI interface.

To use the Roomote iPhone App in its initial implementation, you need the following: 

1. A Roomba 400 or 500 series robot (or Create)
2. An iPhone or iPod touch (any version)
3. A serial cable or Bluetooth adapter to connect your robot to your computer
4. A Mac computer to run a server program and relay commands from the iPhone to the robot (Sorry Windows folks, I haven't ported the server to Windows. If you'd like to do so, though, I've made the source code available. Scroll to the bottom of this page for more information.)

This repository includes the Roomote iPhone app as well as the Roomote Server application for Mac OS X (originally designed and built for Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard).
